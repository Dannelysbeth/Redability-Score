<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, you will program the <strong>Automated readability index (ARI)</strong>. It was introduced in 1968 and a lot of research works rely on this. The index is calculated by the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(score = 4.71 \times \dfrac{characters}{words} + 0.5 \times \dfrac{words}{sentences} - 21.43\)</span></p>
<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article on ARI</a> can give you more specifics on the application and age brackets.</p>
<p>Below you can see the table that specifies the age brackets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="readability score table" height="421" name="Readability_score-2.png" src="https://ucarecdn.com/35bc7c5a-901d-4096-8ae2-e929ea9288e3/" width="745"/></p>
<p>Also, your program should read a file instead of typing a text manually. You should pass the filename through the command line arguments.</p>
<p>The program should output the score itself and an approximate age needed to comprehend the text.</p>
<p>Use the appropriate rounding function to calculate the score as integer.</p>
<p>You should also print how many characters, words, and sentences the text has.</p>
<p>The number of characters is any visible symbol (so, in the real text it's everything except space, newline "\n" and tab "\t").</p>
<p>Notice, that the text can contain multiple lines, not just a single line like in the previous stages. You should analyze all the lines.</p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; java Main in.txt

Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. In natural language, the readability of text depends on its content and its presentation. Researchers have used various factors to measure readability. Readability is more than simply legibility, which is a measure of how easily a reader can distinguish individual letters or characters from each other. Higher readability eases reading effort and speed for any reader, but it is especially important for those who do not have high reading comprehension. In readers with poor reading comprehension, raising the readability level of a text from mediocre to good can make the difference between success and failure
